// Package upload contains all upload related API stuff.
//
// Upload API is an addition to the REST API. It provides several ways of uploading
// files to the Uploadcare servers.
// Every uploaded file is temporary and subject to be deleted within a 24-hour
// period. To make any file permanent, you should store or copy it.
//
// The package provides uploading files by making requests with payload to
// the Uploadcare API endpoints. There are two basic upload types:
//
// - Direct uploads, a regular upload mode that suits most files less than 100MB
// in size. You wonâ€™t be able to use this mode for larger files.
//
// - Multipart uploads, a more sophisticated upload mode supporting any files
// larger than 10MB and implementing accelerated uploads through
// a distributed network.
